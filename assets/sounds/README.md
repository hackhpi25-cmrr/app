## Recommendations for Sound Files

- Use high-quality MP3 files (128kbps or higher)
- Keep file sizes reasonable (under 5MB each if possible)
- Choose sounds without sudden changes that could be jarring
- For looping sounds (like white noise), ensure they loop smoothly
- For timed sounds (like nature sounds), 30-60 seconds of high-quality sound is sufficient as they'll be looped

If you have issues with the audio implementation, check the SoundManager.ts file for the audio handling logic.
